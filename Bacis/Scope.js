 // ******************* closures *******************


// the inside function accessing outside variable is known as closures
//it's happening here the two function is accsessing varible username outside
function one(){
    const username = `krishna`;        

    function two(){
        const price  = 88;

// *********************** hoisting *********************

console.log(sum(88));

    return num+1;
}

//console.log(ans(88))  //it gives error

const ans = function(num){
    return num+56;
}

console.log(ans(88)); // it doesn't gives 

// *** important

// in sum fucntion it just a fucntion so we can call it before or after the function code but
//if you store it in varible directly then you should call it after your function code
